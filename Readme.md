Employee directory APP
 
The Employee directory app allows users to view all of the employees that are employed by the company.
Once the app is loaded it returns an Image of the employee, Full name, E-mail, Phone, DOB. 
Users are also able to search for an employee using a search box by typing characters that are included in the name of the employee.
 
Employee list is generated from a free employee generating API. As the application is loaded this app gets a random list of employees from API using AXIOS.
